# Flowcharts with Flowgorithm

Flowgorithm is a Visual Programming Language (VPL) that use flowcharts. Flowcharts are used to show how program code is organized. There used for planning and show the flow of the programming. They are also good for education and learning. Probably a good aid for the beginner programmer. Programmers do not normally use programming flowcharts. if you are working on large software systems and have lots of code with many people working on them, can be a good thing.

I write small sets of code all the time in several programming language. For this reason, I am checking out Flowgorithm. Just want to see if you can create a flowchart and the generate source code that can be compile or interpreted in several computer languages.
