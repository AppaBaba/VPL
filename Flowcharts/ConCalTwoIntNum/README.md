## Console Calculate for Two Integers Numbers
Made a simple flowchart for addition, subtraction and multiplication of two numbers. Generated code for Cpp, VB, and C#. The Cpp code compiled as is with no change to code. The Visual Basic compile with removing only one line of code. This version of Visual Basic did not require Import system. Now for C#, had to do some editing. Two lines of code did not have terminators on them. Also relocate some output code to another location because it was not defined in current location. All said, I think it work nicely.
