# VPL
## Visual Programming Languge
### Description
A Visual programming languge (VPL) is code that is represented by visual image. There are many VPLs. There will only be one or two maybe more on this repository. We will see.

Some of the one I have used to educate others and myself are:
1.	Alice
2.	Blocky
3.	Flowgorithm
4.	Kodu
5.	MakeCode
6.	mBlock
7.	Sratch
